Utilize various programming languages to develop secure, efficient code
- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. The task is to build a prototype interfacing system for Wildlife Zoo in C++ that incorporates all of their requested functionality.
- What did you do particularly well, where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? When it comes to finding specific errors, I felt things easy to find but I seemed to be have difficulties finding the correct solution to use right away.
- Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network. I had a good support network of close friends that have been helping me through the course and this project that have been studying the field and working in the field for numerous years.
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? Being able to find and fix errors I think will be huge going into the classes and jobs into the future.
